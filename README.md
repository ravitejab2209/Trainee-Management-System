# Trainee Management System

#### The Trainee Management System is a Full Stack Java project that allows you to manage trainee details. It uses Servlets and JSP for the front-end and interacts with a MySQL database for data storage. With this system, you can perform the following operations:

### Create Trainee Details: Add new trainees to the system by providing their information such as name, age, and department.

### Delete Trainee Details: Remove trainees from the system based on their unique identifiers (e.g., trainee ID).

### Fetch Trainee Details: Retrieve trainee information by searching for specific trainees using their IDs or other criteria.

### Update Trainee Details: Modify existing trainee records, such as updating their department or contact information.

### View All Trainees: Get an overview of all trainees in the system at once.


## Technologies Used

### Java: The core programming language for the backend logic.

### Servlets: Handle HTTP requests and responses.

### JSP (JavaServer Pages): Create dynamic web pages.

### MySQL Database: Store trainee data.

HTML/CSS: For the user interface.
